Closing Remarks
===============

In creating this visualizer, I learned a lot about 3D graphics and how to
synchronize seemingly independent processes. My main struggle was implementing
specific transformations on the scene camera - it turns out that I don't know
enough yet about how these work to implement complicated ones. I definitely
enjoyed building it and plan to continue improving on it as I learn more 3D
techniques. If I could do it over, i would have spent a bit more time ensuring
that it worked cross-platform, since right now linux is the only reliable
system to run it on. That said, I think this project is awesome and look forward
to continuing it.
